And Omnivores </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:40px;text-align:center;"> Herbivores</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height: 30px;margin-bottom: 80px;">A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically evolved to feed on plants, especially upon vascular tissues such as foliage, fruits or seeds, as the main component of its diet. These more broadly also encompass animals that eat non-vascular autotrophs such as mosses, algae and lichens, but do not include those feeding on decomposed plant matters (i.e. detritivores) or macrofungi (i.e. fungivores).

As a result of their plant-based diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouth structures (jaws or mouthparts) well adapted to mechanically break down plant materials, and their digestive systems have special enzymes (e.g. amylase and cellulase) to digest polysaccharides. Grazing herbivores such as horses and cattles have wide flat-crowned teeth that are better adapted for grinding grass, tree bark and other tougher lignin-containing materials, and many of them evolved rumination or cecotropic behaviors to better extract nutrients from plants. A large percentage of herbivores also have mutualistic gut flora made up of bacteria and protozoans that help to degrade the cellulose in plants,[1] whose heavily cross-linking polymer structure makes it far more difficult to digest than the protein- and fat-rich animal tissues that carnivores eat.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:40px;text-align:center;"> Carnivors</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height: 30px;margin-bottom: 80px;">The word carnivore is derived from Latin and literally means “meat eater.”

A carnivore is an animal that feeds on other animals.

Carnivores come in many shapes in sizes, but they often have some similarities. Most carnivores have relatively large brains and high levels of intelligence. They also have less complicated digestive systems than herbivores. The world's largest animal is also the world's largest carnivore.

There are many different kinds of carnivores from small spiders that catch and eat insects, to lions that hunt and kill their food.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:40px;text-align:center;"> Omnivers</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height: 30px;margin-bottom: 80px;">Omnivores are animals that feed on other plants and animals for nutrition.”

There is no exact meaning or definition of an omnivore. According to biologists, omnivores have no specific taxon. For instance, most carnivores such as lion and tigers belong to the order Carnivora. However, omnivores are spread across multiple taxons.

Furthermore, most species are evolutionarily geared towards one particular form of a diet, but they do deviate when the circumstances require them to do so.

A most important example of this is the Virginia deer, also called as the whitetail deer. They are a medium-sized deer, which is strictly a herbivore but has been documented to capture and eat birds.</p>
